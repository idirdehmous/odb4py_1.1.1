# odb4py 1.1.0 release

## Description

**odb4py** is a C/Python interface to read and query ECMWF ODB1 databases.<br>
It provides high-performance access to ODB data through a native C backend, with seamless integration into the Python scientific ecosystem.<br>
The package embeds a customized version of the ECMWF ODB software [odb_api_bundle-0.18.1-Source](https://confluence.ecmwf.int) and is distributed as **manylinux wheels**, requiring no external ODB installation.

---

## Features

- Native C backend based on ECMWF ODB1
- Support for IFS and ARPEGE ODB databases
- SQL-like query interface
- Fast data access with NumPy and pandas integration
- manylinux wheels (portable across Linux distributions)
- No runtime dependency on system ODB or ECMWF bundles

---

## Installation

The **odb4py** package can be installed from PyPI using `pip`:

```bash
pip install odb4py
```

## Installation test 
`from odb4py import core  # The C extension` <br>
`from odb4py import utils # The pure python modules ` 



## Requirements
Python ≥ 3.9 <br>
NumPy  ≥ 2.0 <br>
Linux system (manylinux2014 compatible)

## Scientific context
ODB (Observation DataBase) is a column-oriented database format developed at ECMWF
and widely used in numerical weather prediction systems such as IFS,ARPEGE and their canonical configurations.<br>

**odb4py** is primarily designed for:<br>
- Meteorologists and atmospheric scientists (especially within the ACCORD consortium)<br>
- Operational and research environments
- Post-processing and diagnostic workflows
- The package focuses on read-only access and data extraction for scientific analysis.
